If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or an architectural design.

**ANSWER: **
Below are my top 5 items to prioritize:
1. Upgrade .Net Framework and Packages : Will not only ensure that your application is supported, this will also improve Application Security.
2. Apply a more secure validation : Given the limited time, UI Validation was not applied properly. 
3. Improve Unit Test Code Coverage : Given the limited time, I was only able to cover a few key Unit Tests
4. Upgrade React Components : Similar to #1, this has plenty of benefits in support and security
5. Perform thorough Code Cleanup : A lot of things can be cleaned on this solution, these were deliberately not cleaned as they might introduce issues.
